# Java CRUD Console application "School"
This is a training project of the mentoring program of the FoxmindEd training center.

According to the program, the developing of this application is consisted of several milestones. At each stage, a new application layer or functionality with required library for implementation it is added. In the final, the application is converted to Web application and some libraries is replaced.

2. Compile applications using this command: './mvnw package'
3. Launch application 'java -jar school-jdbc-api.jar'

## Application components

The application includes the following components:

* Build tool (**Maven**)
* ORM (**Hibernate**)
* IoC (**Spring, SpringBoot**)
* Unit tests (**JUnit5**)
* Database versioning (**Flyway**)
* Way of interacting with DB (**JDBC API**)
* DB Tests (**Testcontainers**)
* Logging (**Log4j2**)
* AOP

Database management system used for data storage: **Postgres** in runtime and use **Testcontainer** during tests.
